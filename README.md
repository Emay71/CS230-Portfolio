CS 230 Module Eight Journal – The Gaming Room Design Document 

Who was the client and what were their software needs? 

The client, The Gaming Room, is a game development company that created a game called "Draw It or Lose It" for Android. They wanted to expand their game to run on multiple platforms with a distributed architecture, ensuring scalability and multi-user capability. 

What did I do particularly well? 

I believe I communicated technical information clearly, particularly in the system overview and platform recommendations. I also ensured my diagrams were easy to follow. 

What part of the process was most helpful? 

Working through the design documentation helped me better understand how to plan features and components before coding. It reinforced the importance of structure and stakeholder communication in software development. 

What would I revise and why? 

I would refine the evaluation matrix section to better justify my platform comparison with more detailed performance metrics and visuals. 

How did I implement user needs? 

I carefully interpreted the need for scalability and platform flexibility from the client’s goals and integrated these into my architecture and technology recommendations. Considering user needs ensures the final product meets real-world expectations and constraints. 

How did I approach software design, and what would I do next time? 

I used a step-by-step design strategy: define goals, identify requirements, evaluate platforms, and model architecture. Next time, I would incorporate more user flow diagrams and stakeholder feedback loops.
